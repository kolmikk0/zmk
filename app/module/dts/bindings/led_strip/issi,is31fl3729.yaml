      Gamma correction lookup values.
      The gamma values make the LED brightness seem more linear to human eyes.
      Default values match the recommendation from the IC datasheet but note this may
      or may not work for your particular LEDs.

  scaling:
    type: array
    required: false
    default: [ 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255 ]
    description: |
      Scaling factor for each CS pin on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of each CS channel relative to other
      channels by scaling the amount of current flowing through them. 255 being
      equivalent to the value of led-max-current.
